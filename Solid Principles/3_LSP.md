## Liskov Substitution Principle

- **Accurate Defination:** Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes.
- The principle defines that objects of a superclass **shall be replaceable** with objects of its subclasses without breaking the
application. That requires the objects of your subclasses to behave in the same way as the objects of your superclass.
